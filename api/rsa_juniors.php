	 <p class="bold"> A community of young athletes dedicated to personal growth, skill development, and a love for the game.</p>
	 <p>The RSA Junior Team is committed to ensuring that its players meet the recommended physical activity guidelines for their age group. Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years should engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day, with most of this activity being aerobic in nature. The team provides a structured, goal-oriented environment that encourages participation in organized sports and physical activity programs.
         The RSA Junior Team also emphasizes the importance of active play, which can involve symbolic activity or games with or without clearly defined rules. Active play tends to occur sporadically, with frequent rest periods, making it difficult to record. The team encourages its members to engage in unstructured/unorganized active play at any intensity for more than 2 hours per day</p><br>
