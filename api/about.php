	 <br><p>In 2015, the Ruiru Sports Academy was founded by a former professional footballer with a vision to provide comprehensive training and support for young athletes in Kenya. The academy was established as a response to the lack of opportunities for talented young players in the region, who often had to choose between their passion for football and their education. The academy began as a small soccer team for under 13-year-old boys, with the goal of fostering a love for the game and promoting discipline, teamwork, and personal growth. Over the years, the academy has grown to offer a wide range of programs for boys and girls aged 5 to 17 years, focusing on football training and academic support. In 2017, the academy made headlines when it was selected as an athletics-village for the IAAF World Under 18 Championships in Nairobi, providing a platform for young athletes to showcase their skills on an international stage. Today, the Ruiru Sports Academy is recognized as a leading football academy in Kenya, with a commitment to nurturing the next generation of talented footballers and helping them reach their full potential both on and off the field.</p><br>
